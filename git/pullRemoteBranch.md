# Pull Down a Remote Branch

`git fetch <remote> <remote_branch>:<local_branch>`

Where `<remote_branch>` is the name of the branch in your centralized repository you want to bring to your local machine and `<local_branch>` is the name you want to have the branch have locally (usually they're the same).
