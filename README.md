# Today I Learned
## A repo for every little tip or trick I learn. I suggest you make one too.

I originally saw [this repo posted on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11068902) and got inspired to formally make a repo of my loose notes that I had written about various job-related tasks that I knew I would come across again, but not often enough to memorize. It has proven itself a great timesaver and even better, I can now link to examples when someone asks about one of the recorded tips.
